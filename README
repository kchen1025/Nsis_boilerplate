This is a template installer for NSIS.

The test.nsi file needs to be compiled with NSIS to get the WelcomeFinish.exe file, but as is, the exe can be run to achieve the following things:

1. It will drop a test.txt on the desktop displaying info like a unique guid, and timestamp information

2. It will drop a folder in programfiles(x86)/ModernUItest that contains a test_folder which contains an empty test.txt file and an uninstall.exe file

3. It will create a start menu icon

4. It will edit the HKCU registry to add the installation directory into the windows regsitry.

5. When done, call uninstall.exe and it will delete all the above files, giving you a clean slate.
